# User Stories

User stories capture how different users interact with PromoShots features, documenting both the user's perspective and the technical implementation details. Each story follows a structured format to ensure clarity and completeness.

## What is a User Story?

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability. It typically follows the format:

> As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

Our user stories expand on this basic format to include:
- **User Personas**: Specific types of users who would use the feature
- **Key Features**: Detailed scenarios using Given/When/Then format
- **Interaction Scenarios**: Real-world examples of how the feature is used
- **Technical Behavior**: Implementation details and constraints
- **Testing Considerations**: How to verify the feature works correctly
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes that indicate feature success
